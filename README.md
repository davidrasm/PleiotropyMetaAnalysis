# PleiotropyMetaAnalysis

Full datasets containing all extracted fitness data and metadata from our meta-analysis of the pleiotropic fitness effects of viral mutations between hosts.

Please see:
Wang X., Muller J., McDowell M., Rasmussen D.A. Quantifying the strength of viral fitness tradeoffs between hosts: A meta-analysis of pleiotropic fitness effects. 2023.

For convenience, the data is provided in two formats:

*single-host-fit-effects-2023-10-11-cleaned.csv* contains the fitness effects of all mutations in single/individual hosts.

*pairwise-fitness-effects-2023-10-11-cleaned.csv* contains all pairwise comparisons of fitness effects between unique host pairs.

All fitness effects are given as fitness ratios: w = w_mut / w_ref.
